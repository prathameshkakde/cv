                    I specialized in skills such as object oriented programming with c++. I have done a skill training program on c and c++ through Internshala’s platform. Where I had developed a non GUI based cricket game application. The entire objective of that project was to extensively learn and implement oops concepts. Another skill that I have is web development. From that I took initiative by myself to develop a fully functional website using PHP. and to boost my web development skills. I also learned the Bootstrap framework to make responsive websites. and now I am looking forward to learning MERN stack for that I am currently enrolled for a complete MERN stack development course. Apart from that, I am also learning to get comfortable using Git and GitHub version control systems along with data structure and algorithms. So that I can improve my programming skills by working more with the programming community.
